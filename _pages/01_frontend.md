            Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.  
            <ul>
                <li>In this class, we will be using Fastpages on top of GitHub Pages to maximize our presentations, while minimizing our front-end coding.</li> 
                <li>In GH Pages, deployment is performed through Jekyll, which regenerates the website automatically after each commit, tracking can be seen in Actions tab within GitHub.</li>
                <li> <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">Liquid</a> is the template language that allows us to store dynamic data within our static pages. </li>

### Sample Code in this Sub Menu

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the front-end of the Web.  Many tools and languages complement development using markup, style and javascript.  This section of the Del Note CS website is providing some code samples.  These are intended to spark your own PBL ideas.  Each of these were generated after watching others teach or interacting with students.
- Binary: This example was created after watching Harvard CS50 by David J. Malan in 2020, he had built a machine to turn on and off lights/binary digits.  Why not in software?
- Graph: This was created when a student named Bryant 2022 asked me the question "how would I plot data?" as described in an FRQ.
- Life: This was created by Nathaniel 2022 when I asked him about something interesting to show students in JS that relates to school.
- Snake: This was interest of students in each of my 3 years, inspiration and some of the code came from a student named Nolan 2021.
