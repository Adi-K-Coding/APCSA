# AP CSA COURSE OUTLINE
- Methodology.  Project Based Learning (PBL)
- Guideline. The 10 Units of AP Computer Science A
- Key Learnings for 2022-2023
    - Collaboratively Build, Deploy and Host Web Pages
    - Programming, Algorithms, Databases, and APIs
    - Team and Individual Project will highlight all 10 units, either academically or in interest fashion
- Establish "Real World‚Äù Scrum Team projects
    - Preference is to establish projects with a Customer/Sponsor
    - Projects will be tracked using GitHub README, Issues and Projects tools
- Create "GitHub Pages" Individual postings and notebooks
    - Build individual GitHub Pages Web Site to track Notes and Learnings
- AP testing in May

## Week 0
- Assignments mostly Due Monday at the start of class (see canvas)
- Mostly live and self grading reviews conducted Monday in class
- 5 point seed (highly engaged +, distracted -)
- Approximately 100 points per trimester

## "Real World" Projects
You, your pair, and your Scrum Team will collaboratively Build, deploy and host Web Site.  This Web project contains Technicals learned throughout the Trimester.  This will be done in increments.  Each Monday assignment will focus on setting up Tools and Methods in becoming a Nighthawk Coder.

- Feature Considerations for Project
    - One unique idea, aka something useful to school
    - Ability to show case individual PBL, Test Prep work and labs
    - A page that highlights YOU and your Technical Capbilities
    - Managing Technical Requirement for Project
    - Use "Java Classes" as well as Units 1-10.
    - Build frontend using "Thymeleaf" or "React" with data coming from "Java Spring".
    - PBL requirements and accomplishments are described through each week/sprint.

## Week 0 Learning Outcome
Getting adapted to the Agile development methodologies used in Computer Science.  Additionally, getting introduced to the Tools used in building a Java/Spring Web Server and managing a personal Notebook using GitHub Pages.

### Establish Comp Sci and PBL attitude
- Attitude.  An Agile mindset is not knowing the answer, making lots of mistakes and performing iteration.  A successful grade is dependent on making mistakes, research, and iteration.
- Suggestion. Please bring a personal laptop to class daily.  The Internet and AP Classroom web site will  be considered text book.  
- Requirements. Everything will be distributed electronically.  All code you develop will be delivered to the Cloud.  
- This class has a NO PAPER policy, when the Teacher sees paper the student will be considered to be distracted (-), Slash/Slash/Slash

### Sprint 0 / Week 0
Wednesday - Pick pair share partner, Pick crossover pair, Establish team of four.  Based off of modulo mathematics (remainder) there can only be 3 teams of 5 maximum.   Spend some time talking and getting to know each other.  Teacher will visit teams as time allows.  
Thursday - Start bringing your laptop.  Tech Talk 0.  Start setting up tools and code for your 1st Web Site.
Friday - Perform as many 0.* Tech Talks as possible.

## Tech Talk 0 - Tools and Equipment
Developer Operations (DevOps) is dependent 
- Java is the key language you will be using in this class.  HTML, CSS, JavaScript are the key supporting technicals you will be using to enhance your learning of Java. 
- VS Code is the code editor we will be using in this class.  VS Code is more than and editor, it is called and IDE (Interactive Development Environment. 
- GitHub is where we store and share code in the cloud, think of Google Docs but for Code. 
- GitHub Pages will be used to host your personal notes and experiences.
- Jupyter Notebooks will be used in conjunction with GitHub Pages to store Technical Notes.
- AWS Cloud Commputing and Servers will be used to Deploy and Support projects.
- Slack is the tool will use for messaging, we have been averaging 35,000 message per class.

### Equipment needed and accounts to maximize class
- A laptop, that you bring to class every day with the Development Tools installed on it.
- GitHub Account
- Slack account
- AWS Account that will be provided by Teacher

### Installation guides (Allie to add stuff to complement this outline)
    - VS Code 
    - JRE and JDK installations
    - Create initial project(s) from GitHub
    - Play your project
    - In Chrome or browser, run localhost:8080
    - Review GitHub concepts, watch video by Michael Hayes.
    - Install Slack app
