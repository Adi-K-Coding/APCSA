# AP CSA COURSE OUTLINE
- Methodology.  Project Based Learning (PBL)
- Guideline. The 10 Units of AP Computer Science A
- Key Learnings for 2022-2023
    - Collaboratively Build, Deploy and Host Web Pages
    - Programming, Algorithms, Databases, and APIs
    - Team and Individual Project will highlight all 10 units, either academically or in interest fashion
- Establish "Real World‚Äù Scrum Team projects
    - Preference is to establish projects with a Customer/Sponsor
    - Projects will be tracked using GitHub README, Issues and Projects tools
- Create "GitHub Pages" Individual postings and notebooks
    - Build individual GitHub Pages Web Site to track Notes and Learnings
- AP testing in May

## Week 0
- Assignments mostly Due Monday at the start of class (see canvas)
- Mostly live and self grading reviews conducted Monday in class
- 5 point seed (highly engaged +, distracted -)
- Approximately 100 points per trimester

## "Real World" Projects
You, your pair, and your Scrum Team will collaboratively Build, deploy and host Web Site.  This Web project contains Technicals learned throughout the Trimester.  This will be done in increments.  Each Monday an assignment will be given and the previous will be under Live Review.

- Feature Considerations for Project
    - Project Requirements
        - A fun zone, unique idea(s)
        - Educational zones that capture every key learning objective
        - A location that highlights individuals, jobs, and technical capabilities
    - Project Technicals
        - Managing PBL Requirement for Project (Issues, Scrum Board)
        - Use of "Java Classes" in backend.
        - Use of "Thymeleaf" in frontend
        - Data Structure exchange between frontend and backend

- Individual GitHub Pages considerations for Java Units 1-10
    - Each week we will be studying Java
    - Design Fastpages/GitHub Pages according to personal style and interests
    - Jupyter Notebooks using IJava and Markdown will be required for Java Test Prep learnings
    - Make sure you are prepared each week to show how you have met Test Prep requirements
    - Additionally, make sure you capture PBL learnings and notes throughout the week


### Establish PBL and Comp Sci attitude
- Attitude.  An Agile mindset is not knowing the answer, making lots of mistakes and performing iteration.  A successful grade is dependent on making mistakes, research, and iteration.
- Suggestion. Please bring a personal laptop to class daily.  The Internet and AP Classroom web site will  be considered text book.  
- Requirements. Everything will be distributed electronically.  All code you develop will be delivered to the Cloud. 
- Grading guidelines. There will be key technical objectives and expected tangibles. 10% deduction and office hours are required for late work.  Essentially, it is impossible to be late if you work consistently in class and turn something in each week.   
    - High "A" is very tough to achieve, something beyond the tangibles.  Something that exhibits an unforced desire to learn.
    - Low "A" is consistency in producing tangibles toward Team Project and Individual GH Page.
    - "B" is having flaws in consistency or tangible shortcomings, but mostly on track.
    - "C" is a lack consistent effort, lacking tangibles.
    - Below "C" is composed of Slash/Slash/Slash offenses. Lack of attendance, disruptive behaviors, doing work from other classes during class time, paper visible in class, and turning in tangbiles that you can't represent in live review.

### PBL Sprint 0 / Week 0
Learning outcome.  Getting adapted to the Agile mindset used in Computer Science.  Additionally, getting introduced to GitHub and VS Code used in building a Java/Spring Web Server and managing a year long personal GitHub Pages to capture notes and experiences.
- Wednesday - Pick pair share partner, Pick crossover pair, Establish team of four.  Based off of modulo mathematics (remainder) there can only be 3 teams of 5 maximum.   Spend some time talking and getting to know each other.  Teacher will visit teams as time allows.  
- Thursday - Start bringing your laptop.  Setup GitHub and Tools and push code to your Repo.
- Friday - Pair Share coding. Spend 30 minutes at keyboard installation and performing Jupyter coding, while Pair Share observes and consults.  Next 30 minutes Pairs reverse roles.  

## Tech Talk 0 - Tools and Equipment
Developer Operations (DevOps) is dependent 
- Java is the key language you will be using in this class.  HTML, CSS, JavaScript are the key supporting technicals you will be using to enhance your learning of Java. 
- VS Code is the code editor we will be using in this class.  VS Code is more than and editor, it is called and IDE (Interactive Development Environment. 
- GitHub is where we store and share code in the cloud, think of Google Docs but for Code. 
- GitHub Pages will be used to host your personal notes and experiences.
- Jupyter Notebooks will be used in conjunction with GitHub Pages to store Technical Notes.
- AWS Cloud Commputing and Servers will be used to Deploy and Support projects.
- Slack is the tool will use for messaging, we have been averaging 35,000 message per class.

### Equipment and accounts required to maximize class
- A laptop, that you bring to class every day with the Development Tools installed on it.
- GitHub Account, VS Code will be used to push/pull changes
- Slack Account, install App on Laptop, get used to reading announcements
- AWS Account for deployment, this will be provided by Teacher
