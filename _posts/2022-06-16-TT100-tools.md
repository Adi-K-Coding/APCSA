## Tools and Equipment make Development Easy
Learning Development tools, working with Projects, is the key to a <mark>rapid entry into Code/Code/Coding</mark>.  A Computer, Git, and an Code Editor are the starting points for coding.
- Computers using either MacOS, Windows, or Linux are requirements for the course.  
- <mark>GitHub</mark>, is Git hosted in the Cloud.  It is <mark>the defacto hosting platform for version control and collaboration</mark>. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere in the world.  Think of it as the Google Docs for Coders.
   - Version Control is the task of keeping a software system of many versions and configurations well organized.
   - <mark>Version Control History</mark> of files and changes in Version Control System (ie GitHub) is very important!  Ultimately, any Coder will break things or delete things! Looking at older versions and configurations at a microscopic detail is sometimes the only way to unwind bugs.
- <mark>Visual Studio Code</mark> (abbreviations VS Code or VSC) is a powerful Code Editor.  VS Code performs a lot of magic and automation behind the scenes to make your Code/Code/Coding life easier.  There is a back-in-the-day story hear, but short version is VS Code qualifies to be called and <mark>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</mark>.  It allows you to Edit files, Build your Code, and Pull/Push Code from and to the GitHub.  FYI, VS Code is new to AP CS this year, former IDE's used in CompSci classes include XCode, Eclipse, and IntelliJ.
- <mark>Jupyter Documents (.ipynb) </mark> is a document format for creating and sharing computational documents.  These documents allow you to compute segments of Python or Java code as you are taking notes.  These are new to AP CS this year, but are viewed as very powerful in gaining a quick understanding of coding concepts.  Jupyter documents are often called "notebooks".


### Equipment, accounts and tools
- A laptop, that you bring to class every day with the Development Tools installed on it.  Computers issued by the School, ie Chromebook, are not effective because of the restrictions placed on adding software by the district.  Please attend Office Hours immediately if you have any problems obtaining a Computer where you can install software.
- GitHub Account, VS Code will be used to push/pull changes. GitHub is where we store and share code in the cloud, think of Google Docs but for Code.
- GitHub Pages will be used to host your personal web site, notes, and experiences.
- Jupyter Documents will be used in conjunction with GitHub Pages to build running Java Code in your Technical Notes.
- Slack Account, install App on Laptop, get used to reading announcements. Slack is the tool will use for messaging, we have been averaging 35,000 message per class.
- Java is the key language you will be using in this class.  Spring, Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, JavaScript are the key supporting technicals you will be using to enhance your learning of Java. 
- VS Code is the code editor we will be using in this class.  VS Code is more than and editor, it is called and Interactive Development Environment (IDE). 
- AWS Account for deployment, this will be provided by Teacher.  AWS Cloud Computing and Servers will be used to Deploy and Support projects.


### GitHub Signup

        Visual Studio Code claims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug and version control cycle.  It provides a Market Place for enhancements and more complex workflows.  Here are some extension that were added by default or that I have added...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><mark>Extension Pack for Java, Debugger for Java</mark>: These are fundamental for Java Development</li>
            <li><mark>Jupyter</mark>: markdown .md files.  This supports build jupyter ipynb files from within VS Code</li>
            <li><mark>Code Spell Checker</mark>: Got to have it when building documents, particularly if you spell and typo like the Teacher.</li>
            <li><mark>IntelliCode</mark>: Got to have it when creating a code file, it will sense type of code by extension.  Also, it help with syntax as you are coding.</li>
        </ul>
