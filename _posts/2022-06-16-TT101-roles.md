            Agile software development uses practices such as ==pair programming==, test-driven development, stand-ups, planning sessions, and sprints.  Agile includes the <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/">12 Principles</a> expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.</p>

### Roles
To ensure transparency during the sprint the Team should meet daily at the daily scrum ( sometimes called a standup). As adaptation for classroom, Team should have a ==standup meeting== for weekly plans, should have assignments for tasks, assignments for integration and deployment.
- ==Scrum Master==: The scrum master helps to facilitate the sprint by ensuring that an agile framework is followed. He/she is committed to traking issues and maintaing scrum board, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow.
- ==DevOps==: DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: version control, integration, managing dependencies, POM file management, AWS deployment are some of the key functions that impact velocity.
- Development Team: The development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, presentors, developers, etc.  Two key roles in Web Development are ...
    - ==Frontend Developer==: A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with.
    - ==Backend Developer==: Back-end developers a build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions like data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see.

### Workload
When planning there is an expectaion of time.  
- Individual in Class Time.  You should expect 3 to 4 hours of productive classroom work each week.
- Individaul at Home Time. To maintain pace in this class, you should consider a 2 hour coding or design session (weekly) outside of class time.  
- Sprint Calculation Time.  5-6 hours of coding or planning per week per individual, or 20-24 hours per team.  If we had a two week Sprint this would be ==40-48 hours== of work.
- Key to success.  Make great use of time in class.  Pair share programming typically provides three time dividend over individual programming when you are learning something new.

### [Issues](https://github.com/features/issues)
Sprint cadences have ideas/issues that are broken into short term work units called tasks.  

### [Scrum Board / GitHub Project / Kanban Style](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects)
The Scrum Board contains issues that are assigned to individuals,  each of these issues will have ==tangible== deliverable links (code/video/...).  Scrum Team will use Scrum Board to understand everyones ideas and efforts.  This includes individual tasks.  Use GitHub Projects add Issues to the board.  Issues are placed in columns on a Scrum Board (==Kanban==) to represent progress.  The below columns have been successful in our academic environment.
1. To do/backlog
2. In progress
3. Complete
4. Deployed
5. Done

### Sprint
Sprint is a period of time that Team uses to plan work and execute work.  This includes planning, research, development, deployment, and test.  Typically, ==sprints will be 2 weeks== or longer in the classroom.  Anytime a sprint lasts longer than a week, there will be a weekly Review Tickets (formative assessment) and concluding with an end of Review Ticket (summative assessment).  Sample sprint follows...
- Week 1
    - Monday - Sprint Objectives, Scrum Team Planning
    - Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led)
    - Wednesday - Code, Code, Code
    - Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher)
    - Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 2, formative review
    - 2 hours outside of class for project work

- Week 2
    - Monday - Sprint Crossover Grading,  Scrum Team Planning
    - Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led)
    - Wednesday - Code, Code, Code
    - Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher)
    - Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 4 including Demos/Review Ticket/Peer, summative review
    - 2 hours outside of class for project work

### Assessments / Reviews
During Teacher reviews meetings ( 1 v 2 pair, 1 v 4 team), the pair or team will provide Teacher with an Issues that that will be called a ==Review Ticket==.  The issue will be completed, referencing Tasks Completed and Self/Crossover Score(s).  Canvas should be used as a guide to completing a review ticket, make sure you acount for everyting.  Make sure Point total is a the top of ticket, if points are important to you!
