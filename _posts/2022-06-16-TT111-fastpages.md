        GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files straight from a repository on GitHub,runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Fastpage is built on top of GitHub pages.  Fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts, so you donâ€™t have to manually run conversion scripts. This tour begins by looking at Explorer in VS Code.  There are three automations to a GH Pages / Fastpages website...

        <ul>
            <li><mark>_notebooks</mark>: jupyter .ipynb files.  This allows building block of markdown, python, java, javascript into a jupyter notebook.</li>
            <li><mark>_posts</mark>: markdown .md files.  This supports frontend web desing with markdown, html, and javascript.</li>
            <li><mark>_word</mark>: word .docx files.  This allows you to save Microsoft or Goggle documents into a docx format.  Saving these directly to _word folder will streamline steps.</li>
        </ul>

### Resources
There are many resource, tutorials, and reference for buiding pages with HTML and Markdown.  On these subjects, I would say learn it when you need it.  Right clicking on Chrome and looking at View Page Source will allow the entire Web to be resource examples.  There are many examples in the code provided.  Here are a couple of link I often refer to for structure reference...
- [HTML on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [Markdown Cheetshee](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

### Home Page
The Home page is source by the index.file file.  This is the place to personalize and customize your home page.  GH Pages / Fastpages build prcess lets you mix markdown and html within this file.

## Hacks
- Publish _notebook file
- Publish _post file with image
- Publis _docx file from Google Doc source
- Personalize index.html file
