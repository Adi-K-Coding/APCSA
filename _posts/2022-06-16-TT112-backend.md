title: TT 1.1.2 Backend Development - Tour of Spring/Java
---

## Tour of Backend
The backend for now is minimal as there is NO backend business logic.  Mastering these simple activities is critical as backend will get much more complicated.

### Main.java
Main.java contains the Class that is used to bootstrap and launch a Spring application from a Java main method.  By default it will load index.html.  

```java
// @SpringBootApplication annotation is key to building web applications with Java https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot
@SpringBootApplication
public class Main {

    // Starts a spring application as a stand-alone application from the main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Main.class, args);
    }

}
```

### Birds.java
This is about as simple as an @Controller can get, it loads a page for view only.  Note the @GetMapping which is used to associate a Web URL (/birds) with a Java Method (public String birds())

```java
@Controller  // HTTP requests are handled as a controller, using the @Controller annotation
public class Birds {

    // CONTROLLER handles GET request for /birds, maps it to birds() method
    @GetMapping("/birds")
    public String birds() {

        // load HTML VIEW (birds.html)
        return "birds";

    }
}
```

### Greet.java
This page is VERY important to master as it is passing data from frontend to backend using @RequestParam with associated keys and values.  The key name is associated with the Java using Wrapper Class, String name.  This is passed back to the template using model.addAttribute("name", name).   Nothing is altered in this example, but it could be.

```java
@Controller  // HTTP requests are handled as a controller, using the @Controller annotation
public class Greet {

    // @GetMapping handles GET request for /greet, maps it to greeting() method
    @GetMapping("/greet")
    // @RequestParam handles variables binding to frontend, defaults, etc
    public String greeting(@RequestParam(name="name", required=false, defaultValue="World") String name, Model model) {

        // model attributes are visible to Thymeleaf when HTML is "pre-processed"
        model.addAttribute("name", name);

        // load HTML VIEW (greet.html)
        return "greet"; 

    }

}
```
