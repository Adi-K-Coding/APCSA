            This visual shows files for a Java Spring Boot Web Application project.  The frontend of the project contains HTML files that are infused with Thymeleaf.  Each frontend file has a backend has a Controller that loads the HTML template.  In this illustration Greet.java loads greet.html, Birds.java loads birds.html, index.html is using default/non-visible Controller to load its page.  This article will discuss the HTML files, the backend will discuss the Java files

### HTML page (index.html)
All files are Thymeleaf infused, thus they are NOT pure HTML.  This allows pre-processor to be run on all HTML files before Java Spring pass the files to the Web Browser.  Here are some things to observe...

Allowing HTML to understand thymeleaf and layouts, you will see introduction of xmlns:layout, xmlns:th, layout:decorate, layout:fragment.  These unusual, non HTML5 references, are REAL to Spring Thymeleaf framework we are using.  Many of the important pieces of HTML for headers, footers, style, and script will not be found in the index.html pages.
- <head> section only contains the title for this page
- <body> section only contains data that is specific to this page
- this and other HTMl pages use "layouts" to form the remainder of the page

```html
<!-- This page is illustrative and contains ideas about HTML formatting -->
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<!-- Signals to the Layout Dialect which layout should be used to decorate this View -->
<html xmlns:layout="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:th="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" layout:decorate="~{layouts/base}" lang="en">

<head>
<th:block layout:fragment="head" th:remove="tag">

</th:block>
</head>

<body>
<th:block layout:fragment="body" th:remove="tag">
    <!-- Start of body content specific to page -->
    <div class="px-4 py-5 my-5">
        <h1><strong>Java and Spring</strong></h1>
        <h3><strong>What should Java Developers learn?</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Java 11-17 is used for PBL. Java 8 appears to be College Board standard.  Java features like Reactive Streams, HTTP2 client, JShell, React JS are more recent than 8.</li>
            <li>GitHub.  Learning to master managing change, branches, pull requests, and more.</li>
            <li>Development DevOps. Java programmers should have a passion for managing the environment and learning automation (Git, Maven, Docker).</li>
            <li>REST and Microservices using Spring.  Mastering creating and consuming RESTful APIs</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><strong>What is Spring?</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spring Framework is the most popular application development framework of Java. </li>
            <li>Spring Boot helps to create a stand-alone application with less configuration.</li>
            <li>Spring MVC is a model view controller-based web framework under the Spring framework.</li>
            <li>ThymeLeaf is a server-side Java template engine, supports HTML5 JVM web development, and provides full integration with Spring Framework.</li>
        </ol>

</html>

### Layouts Folder
This folder contains a base.html and two fragments: footer.html and nav.html.  These files form the standards for the Web Application project.  The layouts/base.html is structural beginning file for index.html, greet.html, birds.html or any future file added to this project.  This connection is made at the top of each HTML template: layout:decorate="~{layouts/base}".

As you look at the layouts/base.html think of it as a Table of Contents of everything that will be in each HTML file.  As you look back at the index.html, consider that it is staring with layouts/base.html and insert its fragments for head and body.

Thymeleaf will put all these things together through a pre-process step.  In the end, every HTML pages that is given to the Web Browser has style and structure from layouts/base, but content from its own HTML head and body.

```html
<!-- This page is illustrative and contains ideas about HTML layouts -->

<html xmlns:layout="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:th="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en">

            Resources are structure in standard directories for many reasons: familiarity amongst developer, tool defaults, deployment defaults, cache optimizations, etc.  Here are some of introductions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> static/images - this is where a web server typically expects images that do not change after deployment.  Service in deployment will cache these files for quick loading over the internet.
                </li>
                <li> static/sccs - these are cached as well.  This location and the sccs name state this will work with node tools.  The standard is called Sassy and is the same as used in Python Flask projects.
                </li> 
                <li> templates/error - error pages can be placed here.  Can you guess were you would put a 500 error page.  
                </li> 
                <li> application.properties - this resource is used to define defaults for the application.  Most of these default are used by backed, for instance this will be used to define location of a database.  This is similar to __init__.py.
                </li>
            </ul>
