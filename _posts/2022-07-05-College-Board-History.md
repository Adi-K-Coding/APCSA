## History of CSA AP Exams

### 2022
Paper exam in Gym, MCQs and FRQs
-	Some Scrum Teams were very connected and worked well within classroom, while others were often caught off task: doing work not related to classroom, or simply goofing off.
    -	One team was resorted to active plagiarism, scores were 3, 1, 1, the 4th member did not test.   Another was out of focus and spent too much time on frontend 4, 1, 1 and two did not test.
    -	Teacher observed teams that were very active in assignments and were perceived effective collaboration 5, 5, 5, 4;  5, 5, 5, 3; 5, 5, 4, 4, and one did not test.
-	Test Prep Tuesday were polarized between hard working individuals not paying attention.   This resorted to Teacher leading Test Prep and abandoning what seemed successful in years past.
-	Stats show there is no middle in the data.  Lots of success and lots of failure.

### 2021
Pandemic and online exam, MCQs and FRQs
-	Scrum Teams were standardized at 4 to 5 people.  Teams were very responsible.
-	Students took on Test Prep Tuesday and produced prepared lessons.  This seemed more comfortable online.
-	The single student that received a 2 was a surprise to me as they were very active in the classroom.
-	Stats show there is no left in this graph, very successful class.

### 2020
Pandemic and online exam, only FRQs
-	My 1st year as Teacher
-	Scrum Teams were too large in some cases, but Teams seemed to be strong.  A few people per group were coat tailing.
-	Students did a lot of async self-administered Test Prep in online groups.  They had a big sense of reaching out to each other.
-	Stats show that most took opportunity.
