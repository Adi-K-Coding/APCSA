### Monday Morning Session 9 - 11 am
People introductions.  Much richer Teaching group.  Mostly from San Diego area.  Most think of the course as a mash up, meaning a complement to their knowledge and self made curriculum.

A lot on Code.org vision, big on equity word.  The APCSA curriculum is brand new.  Even the facilitators have not used it much.

8 virtual support sessions 5-7pm in evening during school year. 2-Day Capstone in Summer.

### Monday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm
