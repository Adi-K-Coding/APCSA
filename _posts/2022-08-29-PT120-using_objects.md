## Points will be awarded on these three key elements

### Code.org  
> Individuals show evidence of completing Code.org through Section 15 or beyond.  Create a Fastpages blog complete with Screen Grabs that highlight key learnings.
- Discuss creating and Using Objects
- Discuss extends

### Java Using Objects and PBL design
> Background.  Build a new Console or Desktop GUI lab showing an area of interest between you and your pair or even as 4s.  Focus is using a the Java Math Class, Planning, and Creating.
- In planning, the Teacher views Java as a backend language.  So, the Console or Desktop UI could be used to serve as an administrative UI for backend developers.  
- Ultimately, for Trimester 1  N@tM final we will be building a Web frontend using the foundation provide by Fastpages.  IMO, the best option for an Administrative UI would be Java using Spring/Spring Boot;  but we may need something more rapid and centralized on Java.

> Action.  Build a rapid Java based Administrative UI thinking about Math class and Math operations as a focus.  A positive, would be starting to build something that you might be interested in for the Trimester N@tM final.  
    - Make a Console application to visualize data from something like Math, Physics, using Jupyter Notebook and Scanner.
    - Make a Java Swing App and explore making a menu with a couple of unique interfaces showing different types of Math Calculators.
    - Idea of your choice

### Live Grading Presentation.  
> Each individual needs to perform their own work. However, I would like to see a plan that show you worked with Pair and/or Team.  The presentation can be according to your own style, but consider the following...
- Note.  A Live Review is expecting students to drive dialog and questions.  Additionally, learn that Teacher likes: questions, discussion of failures, showing a progressive mindset.
- Individual.  A blog that highlights learnings and takeaways from Code.org
- Pair/Team.  A blog that shows Math Library Project / Or Idea of Choice
    - A shared repository, team or pair.  My suggestion is using Spring Portfolio project as template, as this is the start to a backend project.   In my projects, I have placed "hacks" directory inside of Spring project and it has worked fine. 
    - Issues or Blag that show you have planned and to divides up work
    - Jupyter notebook or Posts that highlights key portions of code and enables me to find or run it quickly.
- Review Ticket. Every time requirements.
    - Create Comment in this Blog.  Crossover grades, Crossover Comments, and Blog(s) used during week.
    - Be prepared to go fast, but show everything in under 5 minutes.  3.5 minutes is preferred time for 4 people.
    - Jupyter Notebooks contain comments and Markdown cells
    - Output of Jupyter code is required in Blogs
