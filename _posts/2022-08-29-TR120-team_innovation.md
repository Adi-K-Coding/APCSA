title: Team focused Innovation Sprint
description: Think about what you need to accomplish in the Trimester based off of what you know, what you have reviewed, and what you think you need to learn to be successful in the class.  Create an Issue, Brainstorm with Team and/or Pair a couple of times in a week, and Start Iterative Development process.  Use the Issue as your final Review Ticket.  As you go through the week make other Issues to serve as a backlog.
