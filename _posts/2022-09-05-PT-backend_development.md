### Iteration Mini-lab - 1
> It is really import that student learn to iterate through Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2D arrays.  The most important aspect of this lesson, all which can pop up in testing...
- Change or add data to the 2D arrays
- Displaying vertically and horizontally
- Display backwards or upside down

### Iteration in Spring Boot - .5
> The hack on this lesson provides some flexibility.  However, with the theme of iteration we are looking for something alters or counts using iteration.
- Build your own word counter using a space as separator,  FYI, sing built in does not teach iteration.
- Idea and inputs of choice.  Find something from another class that helps you study for it.

### Deployment on AWS - 1
