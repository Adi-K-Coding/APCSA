## Points will be awarded on these three key elements

### FRQ
> During the year we want to learn the four types of FRQs. This week we want to focus on the first type.

> Focus and 4 types Types
- Methods and control structures (Focus)
    - Pick question type 01 from one of the years posted on the former EXAM page.  Solve the problem, including missing pieces in a Jupyter Notebook.  
    - Make this a quality blog.  My suggestion is Pairs do different FRQs and crossovers do the same, to make grading more valuable.
    - Browse through multiple questions, find a question that may be somewhat like a PBL interest.
- Classes
- Array/ArrayList
- 2D Array 

### Java Lesson
> As a pair or team pre[are a lesson on Unit 3 (or prepare a lesson any of Unit #1, #3, or #4).   The lesson should be focused on "Methods and Control structures"
- Read Hacks from previous or future lesson in College Board blogs to assist with this process
- Jupyter Notebook expected.

> Describe and introduce how you would Present the Lesson(s).  Consider an activity or illustration other than Code, Code, Code.  Review and grade each others FRQs. 
- Review and Review Ticket. 
    - Every time requirements.
        - Create Comment in this Points Blog.  Include crossover grades, crossover comments, and blog(s) used during week.
        - Be prepared to present fast, be clear, and show everything in under 5 minutes.  3.5 minutes is preferred time for 4 people.
        - Jupyter Notebooks contain comments and markdown cells that describe work.
        - Output of Jupyter Notebook is required when posting the Blog.
