description: Look for a real need.  Program Design, ideation, and eventual development work a lot better if you have a real need or an idea of purpose.

## Project Ideas
> Look for a real need, Teacher/Student need, Educational Study or Simulation, Campus Club, Campus Interest, Business Interest, Charitable Organization, etc.  Of course, the greatest interest is <mark>Student Interest</mark>.  It does not work if only one student is interested.
- Starting Objective is to begin a code base.  Part of the vision is to  build skills for AP and Teacher requirements.  
- Be sure to pick something that you don't burn out on after a couple of weeks.  If you are a couple days into something and it is not working it is best to change. 
- IMO, it is much more interesting to work on something that has 3rd party interest and that you can ultimately acquire a 3rd party interest.  Working to acquire accolades is a big motivator.

> PBL. Concept/Idea in CSA Education.  This could be achieved using Blogging and Jupyter.  Some have said, it is possible to pass the AP exam in 1 month of study.  This would be 30 lessons / 1 hour lessons.
- Highlight all 10 Units from CB.
- Remake CB site to be Student Friendly, More Code, and less Video.
- The Web Site covers key topics from CB, also includes Mini-labs, and thus should be interactive.  The code and visuals should teach more than the words.
- FRQs could be challenges or hack-a-thon activities that could enhance a Test Prep sessions. 

> PBL. Concept/Idea around Classroom Management. Build data for a series of classroom needs.  This could be CompSci, but these requirements are for me.
- A system were students can do administration.  
    - Users and Passwords.   A single source for all projects to minimize duplication of data across periods and transitions during year.  Graduation year would be a big key, to active or alumni.
    - Access through accounts RESTful API
    - User Setting and Attributes for students to be self updated
- Attributes
    - Name, Grad year, and some other basics (birth day without year)
    - Password integration with Email
    - GitHUB ID, Slack ID
    - Track student history
        - Track All GitHub projects for the user through Year (Tri 1,2,3)
        - Track all Period through year
        - Roles of Development for User through Year
        - Scrum Teams and other students worked with
        - Pull sources like GitHub commits
        - Runtime project that are alive
    - Integration with GithUb pages, ability to Comment on assignments
- Backup of Data to JSON
- Restore Data from JSON

## Hacks
> Now is time to transition to Design and Development. Designs are required and must meet Teacher Approval.  If you get negative feedback act quickly.  Designs should be put together around a Blog. 
- Brain Write. The process of just elaborating on ideas and sharing them with your team.
- Wire Frame, Concept.  Before coding start to outline what the project will look like.
- Modeling or UML.  Behavior, Interaction, Data diagrams

> Additionally, some development of Concepts can/should occur.  This should be focused on frontend or backend concepts.
- Frontend.  Wire Frame development is better than coding, at early stages.  But if you have clear idea and can articulate it in HTML or CSS it is OK to work there as well.
- Backend. Jupyter notebooks is a great way to thing about data and outputs.  Often a console program can help you imagine data as well as interaction.
