A Computer, Git, and an Code Editor are the starting points for coding. Computers using either MacOS, Windows, or Linux are requirements for the course. GitHub, is Git hosted in the Cloud. It is the defacto hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere in the world. Think of it as the Google Docs for Coders. Version Control is the task of keeping a software system of many versions and configurations well organized. Version Control History of files and changes in Version Control System (ie GitHub) is very important! Ultimately, any Coder will break things or delete things! Looking at older versions and configurations at a microscopic detail is sometimes the only way to unwind bugs. Visual Studio Code (abbreviations VS Code, VSCode or VSC) is a powerful Code Editor. VSCode performs a lot of magic and automation behind the scenes to make your Code/Code/Coding life easier. There is a back-in-the-day story hear, but short version is VSCode qualifies, IMO, to be called and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It allows you to Edit files, Build your Code, and Pull/Push Code from and to the GitHub. FYI, VSCode is new to APCS this year, former IDE’s used in CompSci classes include XCode, Eclipse, and IntelliJ. Jupyter Documents (.ipynb) is a document format for creating and sharing computational documents. These documents allow you to compute segments of Python or Java code as you are taking notes. These are new to AP CS this year, but are viewed as very powerful in gaining a quick understanding of coding concepts. Jupyter documents are often called “notebooks”.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">TT 1.1.0 Focus and Habits - Yale Professor on Successful People</title><link href="https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSA/techtalk/2022/06/16/TT110-focus.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="TT 1.1.0 Focus and Habits - Yale Professor on Successful People" /><published>2022-06-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSA/techtalk/2022/06/16/TT110-focus</id><author><name></name></author><category term="techtalk" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Psychology and the Good Life, by Laurie Santos This video is very relevant to students.
