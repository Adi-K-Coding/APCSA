            Visual Studio Code claims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug and version control cycle.  It provides a Market Place for enhancements and more complex workflows.  <mark>Before adding extensions, clone projects</mark> and see what is requested or added.  Here are some extension that were added through that process or that I have added...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
<mark>Extension Pack for Java, Debugger for Java</mark>: These are fundamental for Java Development</li>
                <li>
<mark>Jupyter</mark>: This supports build jupyter ipynb files from within VS Code</li>
                <li>
<mark>Code Spell Checker</mark>: Got to have it when building documents, particularly if you spell and typo like the Teacher.</li>
                <li>
<mark>IntelliCode</mark>: Got to have it when creating a code file, it will sense type of code by extension.  Also, it help with syntax as you are coding.</li>
                <li><mark>Java / Spring behind the scenes</mark></li>: Language Support for Java, Maven for Java, Project Manager for Java, Spring Boot Dashboard, Spring Boot Extension Pack, Spring Initializr Java Support, Test Runner for Java&lt;/li&gt;
            </ul>
            <p>
            <mark>Review Details in Marketplace for better explanation of purpose of the things explained above</mark>. There is a lot more!  As you need Git help look at things like <mark>Git History and GitLens</mark>.  Or, perhaps you enjoy Vim and want Vim emulation for editing, their is an extension for that.  Later, there may be interest in AWS Toolkit or Deploy extensions.  We will learn more about Marketplace Extensions as we do more.
